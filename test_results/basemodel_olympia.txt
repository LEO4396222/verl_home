  response: ["To determine the largest constant \\( C > 0 \\) such that for any sequence of positive real numbers \\( c_1, c_2, c_3, \\ldots \\) where \\( c_i < C \\) for all \\( i \\), Turbo can ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across, we need to analyze the behavior of Turbo's movement.\n\nFirstly, let's understand how Turbo moves. Each time Turbo moves, he chooses to move either clockwise or counterclockwise. The key insight here is that the total distance moved in one complete cycle (either clockwise or counterclockwise) must be less than 1 because the circumference of the circle is 1.\n\nGiven this, let's consider the sum of the distances \\( c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + \\cdots \\). Since each \\( c_i < C \\), the maximum possible value for the sum of these distances is \\( nC \\) (where \\( n \\) is the number of terms in the sequence).\n\nHowever, since the total distance moved in one complete cycle cannot exceed 1, the sum of the distances \\( c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + \\cdots \\) must be less than or equal to 1. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + \\cdots \\leq 1 \\]\n\nThis implies that the sum of the distances \\( c_1, c_2, c_3, \\ldots \\) is bounded above by 1. Now, let's consider what happens when Turbo starts at a point on the circle and continues moving according to the given sequence. If the sum of the distances \\( c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + \\cdots \\) is less than 1, then after completing several cycles, Turbo will eventually return to his starting point without having visited any new points on the circle.\n\nIf the sum of the distances \\( c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + \\cdots \\) were greater than 1, then Turbo would have to cover more than half of the circle before returning to his starting point, which is not possible under the constraints given. Therefore, the only way for Turbo to avoid visiting any new points on the circle is if the sum of the distances is exactly 1.\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that Turbo can ensure that there is some"]

Similarly, the circle labeled \\( Y \\) is tangent to all ten other circles, meaning it is tangent to nine smaller circles and one larger circle.\n\nLet's start with the circle labeled \\( W \\).

  response: ['To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of reflection and similar triangles. Here’s how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**\n   - Since the laser beam reflects off \\(DF\\) at \\(E\\), and then off \\(FH\\) at \\(G\\), we have two angles that are equal due to the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection).\n   - This means that triangles \\(DEB\\) and \\(EGF\\) are similar because they share angle \\(E\\) and both have right angles.\n\n2. **Set Up Proportions:**\n   - From the similarity of triangles \\(DEB\\) and \\(EGF\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{BD}{BE} = \\frac{EF}{ED}\n     \\]\n   - Given \\(DE = EF = 1 \\text{ m}\\), we substitute these values into the proportion:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{BD}{BE} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(BD\\):**\n   - Since \\(BD = BE\\), we conclude:\n     \\[\n     BD = BE\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the length of \\(BD\\) is equal to the length of \\(BE\\).\n\nThus, the length of \\(BD\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\) meter.']
