  response: ["To solve for \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), we start by expressing the given sum in a more manageable form.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the double sum:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\n\\]\n\nWe can change the order of summation. Instead of summing over all pairs \\((j, k)\\) where \\(j \\geq k\\), it is easier to consider the range of \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) such that \\(j + k \\leq n\\) for some large \\(n\\). This means \\(k \\leq n - j\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\nThis is because for each fixed \\(n\\), \\(j\\) ranges from 1 to \\(n-1\\) (since if \\(j \\geq n\\), then \\(k \\geq n-j > n\\)).\n\nNow, we can factor out the constant term \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1\n\\]\nThe inner sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1\\) is simply \\(n-1\\). So we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{n-1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThis is a known series expansion for \\(\\zeta(2) - \\zeta(3)\\), where \\(\\zeta(s)\\) is the Riemann zeta function. Specifically, \\(\\zeta(2) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} = p\\) and \\(\\zeta(3)\\) is the value of this series at 3. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right) = p - \\zeta(3)\n\\]\n\nThus, the original sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j+k)^3}\\) is equal to \\(p - \\zeta(3)\\). Since \\(\\zeta(3)\\) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions or simple constants like \\(p\\), but knowing the problem context implies a simpler relationship, we conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p - \\zeta(3)}\n\\]"]

  response: ["To determine which student has the greatest average speed, we need to calculate the average speed for each student based on the given data. The average speed is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time taken.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following points:\n- Evelyn: (1.25, 4.5)\n- Briana: (2.5, 2.2)\n- Carla: (4.25, 5.2)\n- Debra: (5.6, 2.8)\n- Angela: (6.8, 1.4)\n\nWe will use the formula for average speed:\n\\[ \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nFirst, let's extract the distances from the y-coordinates since the x-coordinates represent time in this context.\n- Distance for Evelyn: \\(4.5\\) units\n- Distance for Briana: \\(2.2\\) units\n- Distance for Carla: \\(5.2\\) units\n- Distance for Debra: \\(2.8\\) units\n- Distance for Angela: \\(1.4\\) units\n\nNext, we can assume that the times corresponding to these distances are proportional to their positions along the horizontal axis. This means that if we plot these points on a coordinate plane with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis, the slope of the line connecting any two points gives us the ratio of distance to time.\n\nLet's find the slopes between consecutive points:\n\n1. Slope between Briana and Carla:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}_{\\text{Briana to Carla}} = \\frac{5.2 - 2.2}{4.25 - 2.5} = \\frac{3}{1.75} = \\frac{3}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{12}{7} \\approx 1.714\n   \\]\n\n2. Slope between Carla and Debra:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}_{\\text{Carla to Debra}} = \\frac{2.8 - 5.2}{5.6 - 4.25} = \\frac{-2.4}{1.35} = \\frac{-2.4}{\\frac{9}{8}} = \\frac{-19.2}{9} \\approx -2.133\n   \\]\n\n3. Slope between Debra and Angela:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope}_{\\text{Debra to Angela}} = \\frac{1.4 - 2.8}{6.8 - 5.6} = \\frac{-1.4}{1.2} = \\frac{-1.4}{\\frac{6}{5}} = \\frac{-7}{3} \\approx -2.333\n   \\]\n\nSince the slopes indicate how much faster or slower each subsequent point is compared to the previous one, we can infer the relative speeds. However, without exact times, we can compare the magnitudes of the slopes directly. A larger absolute value of the slope indicates a greater rate of change in distance over time, thus indicating a higher average speed.\n\nComparing the magnitudes of the slopes:\n- Slope between Briana and Carla: \\(\\frac{12}{7} \\approx 1.714\\)\n- Slope between Carla and Debra: \\(\\frac{-19.2}{9} \\approx -2.133\\)\n- Slope between Debra and Angela: \\(\\frac{-7}{3} \\approx -2.333\\)\n\nThe largest magnitude of the slope is \\(\\frac{12}{7}\\), which corresponds to the distance covered by Carla relative to Debra. Therefore, Carla has the greatest average speed.\n\nThus, the student with the greatest average speed is \\(\\boxed{\\text{Carla}}\\)."]

An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length. Since the perimeter of one of these triangles is 21 inches, we can find the length of one side of the equilateral triangle by dividing the perimeter by 3:\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of one equilateral triangle} = \\frac{21}{3} = 7 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Therefore, if each of these smaller triangles has a side length of 7 inches, then each side of the hexagon will also be 7 inches long (since the hexagon is composed entirely of these smaller equilateral triangles).\n\nSince a regular hexagon has six sides of equal length, the total perimeter of the hexagon is:\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of the hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{side length of the hexagon} = 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThus, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is \\(\\boxed{42}\\)."]

  response: ["To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers, we start by expressing the sum of three consecutive integers in a general form. Let the three consecutive integers be \\(n-1\\), \\(n\\), and \\(n+1\\). Their sum is:\n\n\\[\n(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n\n\\]\n\nWe need this sum to be a perfect cube. Therefore, we need \\(3n\\) to be a perfect cube. This means that \\(n\\) must include factors such that when multiplied by 3, the result is a perfect cube. The simplest way to achieve this is for \\(n\\) itself to be a multiple of 3, because then \\(3n\\) will already have all necessary prime factors with at least the power needed to make it a perfect cube.\n\nLet's try \\(n = 6\\):\n\n\\[\n3n = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nSince 18 is not a perfect cube, let's try the next multiple of 3, which is \\(n = 9\\):\n\n\\[\n3n = 3 \\times 9 = 27\n\\]\n\nSince 27 is a perfect cube (\\(3^3\\)), \\(n = 9\\) works.

The proper divisors are those that are less than 284, which are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of these proper divisors:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the proper divisors of 220. Again, using the prime factorization \\(220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\\), the proper divisors of 220 are all the divisors of 220 except 220 itself. These divisors are:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110 \\]\n\nWe now calculate the sum of these proper divisors:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 286 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is \\(\\boxed{286}\\)."]

This means that the amplitude \\(a\\) of the sine function is half the difference between the maximum and minimum values:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{3 - (-1)}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2.\\]\n\nThe general form of the sine function with these parameters is \\(y = 2 \\sin(bx + c) + d\\).

The standard sine function \\(y = \\sin(x)\\) has its maximum at \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). For our function \\(y = 2 \\sin(bx + c) + 1\\), the argument of the sine function must be such that it achieves its maximum when \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).

  response: ['To determine the minimum compound interest rate required for the worker to accumulate at least \\$66,200 in his savings account by the end of the third year, we need to calculate the future value of the initial deposit with different interest rates until we find one that meets or exceeds the target amount.\n\nThe formula for the future value \\( A \\) of a single sum deposited at the end of each year with compound interest is given by:\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + r\\right)^n \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( A \\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) is the principal amount (the initial deposit).\n- \\( r \\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for.\n\nIn this problem, the principal \\( P \\) is \\$20,000, and the number of years \\( n \\) is 3.

  response: ["To solve for the function \\( f \\) given the functional equation \\( f(x) + f(y) = f(x + y) - xy - 1 \\) and the initial condition \\( f(1) = 1 \\), we will start by finding a general form for \\( f \\).\n\nFirst, let's substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the functional equation:\n\\[ f(0) + f(y) = f(y) - 0 \\cdot y - 1 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ f(0) = -1 \\]\n\nNext, let's substitute \\( y = 0 \\) into the original equation:\n\\[ f(x) + f(0) = f(x) - x \\cdot 0 - 1 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) - 1 = f(x) - 1 \\]\nwhich is true and doesn't give us new information.\n\nNow, let's assume \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). We know from the problem statement that \\( f(1) = 1 \\), so substituting \\( x = 1 \\) into our assumed form gives:\n\\[ a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 1 \\implies a + b + c = 1 \\]\n\nWe also need to determine the coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). To do this, we can use the functional equation again. Substitute \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\) into the original equation:\n\\[ (ax^2 + bx + c) + (ay^2 + by + c) = a(x+y)^2 + b(x+y) + c - xy - 1 \\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[ ax^2 + ay^2 + bx + by + 2c = ax^2 + ay^2 + 2axy + bx + by + c - xy - 1 \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ 2c = c - xy + 2axy - 1 \\]\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ c = 2axy - xy - 1 \\]\n\nSince this must hold for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), let's consider specific values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).

Now substitute \\( c = -1 \\) back into the equation \\( a + b + c = 1 \\):\n\\[ a + b - 1 = 1 \\implies a + b = 2 \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( a + b = 2 \\)\n2. \\( c = -1 \\)\n\nFrom these, we know \\( c = -1 \\). So, the function becomes \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx - 1 \\). Using \\( a + b = 2 \\), we can express \\( b \\) as \\( b = 2 - a \\).

  response: ['To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 7 people around a round table such that no two of the three specific people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) sit next to each other. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the solution.\n\nFirst, let\'s calculate the total number of unrestricted seating arrangements for 7 people around a round table. Since rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical, the number of distinct seating arrangements is given by:\n\\[\n(7-1)! = 6! = 720\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where at least one pair of Pierre, Rosa, or Thomas sits next to each other. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to do this.\n\nLet\'s define the following sets:\n- \\(A\\) is the set of arrangements where Pierre and Rosa sit next to each other.\n- \\(B\\) is the set of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas sit next to each other.\n- \\(C\\) is the set of arrangements where Rosa and Thomas sit next to each other.\n\nWe want to find the size of the complement of the union of these sets, i.e., the number of arrangements where none of them sit next to each other.
