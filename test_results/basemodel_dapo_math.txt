  response: ["To solve this problem, we need to understand how the frequency of vibration changes with respect to the tension in the rope.

  response: ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between Alex and Alice when they meet and then find the fraction of the distance from Alex's starting point where they meet.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the effective speeds of both Alex and Alice considering the current of the river:\n- Alex's speed relative to the ground = \\( 6 - 2.3 = 3.7 \\) mph (upstream)\n- Alice's speed relative to the ground = \\( 6 + 2.3 = 8.3 \\) mph (downstream)\n\nLet \\( t \\) be the time it takes for them to meet.

  response: ['To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the original cube and subtract the total volume of the holes that have been cut out.\n\n1. **Volume of the Original Cube**:\n   - Side length of the cube = 3 inches.\n   - Volume \\( V_{\\text{cube}} \\) = \\( s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length.\n   - Therefore, \\( V_{\\text{cube}} = 3^3 = 27 \\) cubic inches.\n\n2. **Volume of Each Hole**:\n   - Each hole is a 2-inch by 2-inch square.\n   - Since there are 6 faces on a cube, there will be 6 holes.\n   - Volume of one hole \\( V_{\\text{hole}} \\) = \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\) cubic inches.\n\n3. **Total Volume of All Holes**:\n   - Total volume of all holes \\( V_{\\text{total holes}} \\) = Number of holes × Volume of one hole.\n   - Therefore, \\( V_{\\text{total holes}} = 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\) cubic inches.\n\n4. **Volume of the Remaining Solid**:\n   - Volume of the remaining solid \\( V_{\\text{remaining}} \\) = Volume of the original cube - Total volume of all holes.\n   - Therefore, \\( V_{\\text{remaining}} = 27 - 24 = 3 \\) cubic inches.\n\nAnswer: 3']

  response: ['To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 8**: This can be calculated using combinations.\n2. **Identify the conditions for a triangle to be equilateral**.\n3. **Count the number of equilateral triangles in the cube**.\n4. **Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen triangle is equilateral**.\n5. **Express the probability as a fraction $\\frac{k}{m}$ and find $k + m$**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Choose 3 Vertices\nThe number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 8 is given by:\n\\[ C(8, 3) = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56 \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Conditions for an Equilateral Triangle\nIn a cube, an equilateral triangle must have all sides equal. In a cube, each face is a square with side length \\(a\\). For three points to form an equilateral triangle, they must lie on a plane parallel to one of the faces of the cube.\n\n#### Step 3: Counting Equilateral Triangles\nThere are 6 faces on a cube. Each face has 4 vertices, but only 2 pairs of opposite vertices will form an equilateral triangle when connected to the center vertex. Therefore, there are:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ faces} \\times 2 \\text{ equilateral triangles per face} = 12 \\text{ equilateral triangles} \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Probability Calculation\nThe probability that a randomly chosen triangle is equilateral is:\n\\[ P(\\text{equilateral}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of equilateral triangles}}{\\text{Total number of triangles}} = \\frac{12}{56} = \\frac{3}{14} \\]\n\n#### Step 5: Expressing the Probability as a Fraction and Finding $k + m$\nHere, $k = 3$ and $m = 14$. Thus,\n\\[ k + m = 3 + 14 = 17 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{17}']

  response: ["To solve this problem, we need to understand how to divide a square into triangles using diagonals and other lines that connect points inside the square while ensuring no three points are collinear.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a square with 2022 points inside it, including all four vertices of the square. We want to draw lines between these points such that they create as many non-overlapping triangles as possible without any three points being collinear.\n\n2. **Dividing the Square**: To maximize the number of triangles formed, we can draw one diagonal across the square. This will divide the square into two right-angled triangles. Now, we add more lines from each vertex of the original square to the new triangle created by the diagonal. Each vertex of the square will be connected to the midpoint of the opposite side of the square, creating additional triangles.\n\n3. **Counting the Lines**:\n   - There are 4 vertices in the square.\n   - For each vertex, there is exactly one line connecting it to the midpoint of the opposite side, which creates an additional triangle for each vertex.\n   - Therefore, drawing lines from each vertex to the midpoints of the opposite sides results in \\(4\\) additional triangles.\n\n4. **Total Triangles**: Initially, the square was divided into 2 triangles by the diagonal. Adding the 4 triangles from the midpoints gives us a total of \\(2 + 4 = 6\\) triangles.\n\n5. **Adding More Lines**: Since we already have 6 triangles, we can continue adding lines from each vertex to the midpoints of the opposite sides until we reach the maximum number of triangles allowed by the constraints given in the problem. However, since the problem specifies that we only consider lines that do not cross over the edges of the square or the existing triangles, we don't need to count further lines beyond the initial setup.\n\nThus, the total number of lines drawn (excluding the original square's edges) is simply the sum of the initial lines plus the additional lines added at each vertex:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total lines} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of lines drawn is \\(4\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(4\\)"]
