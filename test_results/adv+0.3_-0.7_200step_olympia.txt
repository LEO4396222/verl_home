  response: [' \n  Answer:\n2\n\nThe problem involves reflection properties of light. Given that angles are equal due to law of reflection (angle incident equals angle reflected), we can use Pythagorean theorem for right triangles formed.\n\nThus,\n  \n   BD = sqrt( DE^2 + EF^2) = sqrt(1^2+1^2)=sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nAnswer:BD =2 meters.\n \n\nFinal result:\n\nboxed {2} .  \n\nlength of BD is thus calculated using above formula. Hence it follows directly from basic trigonometry rules applied here correctly. Thus lengths involved form right triangle sides so Pythagoras rule applies properly hence direct calculation yields correct value. So this example shows how geometrically reflecting beams work mathematically. This also proves important basics like Pythagoreans theorem used here directly applicable to such problems easily solved with these simple steps.

  response: ['Answer:\n7\n\nEach time we divide each square into 4 pieces that form a new L-shape with one side being half length of original sides thus forming more total number of such small ones per level up to next higher order count so after every iteration above steps apply recursively until last remaining units left out only basic unit forms itself directly hence counting all these together add them up accordingly']
